## Credit / Home Loans - EDA and Beskope ML

This project includes a Jupyter Notebook providing a walkthrough for a technical audience as well as a Powerpoint Presentation summarising the points in the Jupyter Notebook to be presented to a non technical audience.
This represents a data scientist's task of using technical knowledge to find solutions to problems in the banking world and then presenting those results to a non technical audience.

This project aims to provide a way to automate the processing of loan applications by creating a machine learning model based on historical data on loan applications. The model will then be evaluated based on its predictions made on test data. Training and testing data both take the form of CSV files, which will be interpreted using Pandas. The motive for this project is to remove the need of humans to process applications and to allow applicants to receive a response immediately upon submission of an application.

To fulfill the objective, the [CRISP DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) data science life cycle will be used. This data science lifecycle includes:

- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modelling
- Evaluation
- Deployment.

 In this project the sweetviz and Pandas Python libraries are used.
